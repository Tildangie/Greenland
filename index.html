<h3>Technology has taken a firm foothold in agricultural development in recent years.</h3> <br>
 In 2020, Google’s parent company Alphabet unveiled prototype machines which can move around fields while collecting data about plants1, such as how they grow and respond to the environment around them. IBM is using a combination of artificial intelligence, the internet of things and predictive analysis to anticipate how weather patterns will affect crop yields. This new focus comes as investors are increasingly recognising the importance of preserving our natural capital – the soil, air and water that we rely on to survive
Many other companies are following similar paths but most have the same aim – using applications to make production more efficient for the farmer and to produce crops with a minimal effect on the environment, ensuring that the lands that produce our food will continue to be fertile for many years into the future. Never before has this been more important given one third of our lands are already degraded due to overly intensive agriculture.
