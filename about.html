<h2>We see energy as a means to achieve our development and humanitarian goals — </h2>
        <p>
             These include creating low-carbon economic opportunities, building sustainable livelihoods, helping people cope and adapt to climate change, ensuring greater food and water security,  and much more. 
            We believe that a market-driven approach led by the private sector is the best path  towards  making a lasting impact. So we put the resources in place that enable companies to expand access to climate-smart energy, to provide vital goods and services powered by energy, and to create the innovation and jobs that drive local economies forward. When energy <br> is more widely accessible, communities can flourish and become more resilient against <br> future shocks.
            Formerly a UK-registered  non-profit organisation, Energy 4 Impact merged with Mercy Corps in 2021. By bringing Energy 4 Impact’s proven energy expertise into Mercy Corps’ large and diverse portfolio of humanitarian and development programmes, we can reach more people in more places, creating a greater impact where it is needed most.
            Energy 4 Impact operates from regional offices in Benin, Kenya, Rwanda, Senegal and Tanzania, supported by a small team in London.

    <p>Funded by the Women’s Philanthropy Group within Mercy Corps, the 12-month Productive Horticulture Solutions for Senegal and Benin that Leverage Clean Energy (POSSIBLE) programme will help 150 smallholder women farmers and rural entrepreneurs in rural off-grid regions of Senegal and Benin to gain access to clean energy technologies. Deploying efficient productive use of energy appliances such as irrigation, refrigeration and processing equipment will not only enable the entrepreneurs to capitalise on more economic opportunities, but it will also increase local food and water security whilst bolstering their resilience to climate change.</p>
